As of today, I have [100 dribbble followers](http://dribbble.com/brtdv). No big deal, I know, but it gave me a boost to try to write stuff on a 'blog'.

I wrote blog in quotes because I don't consider myself a writer, and I definitely don't want to bother you with stories and anecdotes about my daily life. Instead, I'll try to post tips and tricks related to problems that I have encountered as a user interface / web designer / developer / engineer / ... I don't know how to call it these days.

So every now and then, I'll post here and I'll also try to link to articles or other howto's that I find interesting and usefull.

Allright let's do this. [LEEERROYYY JENNNKINSSS!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkCNJRfSZBU)
