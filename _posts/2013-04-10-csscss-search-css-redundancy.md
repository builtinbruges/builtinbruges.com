The creators of the [Chosen][chosen] jQuery plugin have released a new tool: [CSSCSS][csscss]. It's a tool that can help you search for duplicate CSS rules.

> One of the best strategies for me to maintain CSS is to reduce duplication as much as possible. It's not a silver bullet, but it sure helps.

> To do that, you need to have all the rulesets in your head at all times. That's hard, csscss is easy. Let it tell you what is redundant.

Looks like something I'll need to check out! You can view the code at [GitHub][csscss_github] or install the ruby gem with `gem install csscss`.
