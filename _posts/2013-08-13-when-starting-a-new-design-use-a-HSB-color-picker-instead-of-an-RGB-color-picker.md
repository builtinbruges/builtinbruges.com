Something [I tweeted about a while ago](https://twitter.com/brtdv/status/357224769571131392), but still proved to be very usefull this week.

> When using colors in PS / Sketch, work with a HSB color chooser instead of RGB. Way easier to find nice matching colors.

It's so much easier to find matching colors when you're using a HSB picker. You can simply toy around with the saturation and brightness, and you'll find matching colors for your design's base color in no time!
