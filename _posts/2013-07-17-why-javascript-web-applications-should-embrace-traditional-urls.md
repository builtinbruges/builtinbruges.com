[A good case][post-url] for the use of normal URL's and the HTML5 History API in javascript Web Applications, particularly in the Backbone.js framework.

While we don't use the Backbone.js framework, we *have* faced the same dilemma a while ago. We also ditched the hash/hash bang URL's in favor of the way nicer HTML5 History API.

> Used correctly, URLs are a great thing. Web development is centered around them: [Cool URLs donâ€™t change][cool-urls-dont-change], [URLs as UI][urls-as-ui], [RESTful HTTP interfaces][restful-http-interfaces], [hackability][hackability] and so on. The concept of HTTP URLs dates back to [1994][1994].

Good URL design is, in my eyes, an essential part of a web application or even website's design.
