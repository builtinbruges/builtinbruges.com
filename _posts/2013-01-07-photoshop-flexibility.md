[Neat blogpost](http://michieldegraaf.com/post/photoshop-flexibility) by Michiel de Graaf.

Instead of just tossing a free PSD up on the web, he explains how he likes to work in Photoshop by using a PSD file as example.

I must say I like working the exact same way: *no* rasterizing and as little irreversible effects or filters as possible. This is easily achieved with Smart Objects and Adjustements Layers (as explained by Michiel).

There's one thing I do different though. To prevent gradient dithering, I use this [handy photoshop action](http://dribbble.com/shots/499495-Remove-the-banding-of-Photoshop-Gradients) by Jeff Broderick. The method is a little different, but in the end it achieves the same goal: getting rid of ugly gradient "banding".
