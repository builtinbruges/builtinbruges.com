I changed this [on my mac](http://f.cl.ly/items/392o420G3T1i150L2Q06/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-14%20at%2012.03.37.png) a while ago by simply setting a new shortcut in the System Preferences' Keyboard panel.

What this does is exactly what Benjamin was looking for. When available, "Paste and match Style" becomes the replacement for ⌘V. If not, ⌘V behaves as "normal"
