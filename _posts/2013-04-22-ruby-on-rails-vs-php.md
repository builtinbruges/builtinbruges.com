Great [PHP/RoR comparison][post-url] by [Leonard Teo][leonardteo]

> PHP is a friendlier entry point into web development than Ruby/Rails. It's easier, there are more resources available and you can get results fast (it might be hackish at times, but it works).

> Ruby/Rails is superior to PHP + existing PHP frameworks (in my opinion). I enjoy working with Ruby/Rails much much more than PHP. I will say, however, that it really is not "easier" than PHP. It's more "automated" so development can be faster, but it definitely does not lower the bar for entry.

Leonard gives a good non-biased overview of hurdles you encounter when you're learning/working with one of both. Worth a read.
