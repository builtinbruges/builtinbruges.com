title: Debugging XHR requests with Safari 6 in Mountian Lion

Since I updated to Mountain Lion, Safari got updated to the latest version: Safari 6. It's faster than Safari 5 and the offline reading lists and ability to open iCloud tabs are nice improvements. However, there is one thing that annoys me: it's no longer possible [to see the POST parameters of XHR requests](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11692946/safari-6s-new-developer-toolbar-doesnt-show-form-data-in-xhr-ajax-requests).

Annoys me endlessly when I'm debugging and I find myself switching to Chrome, which has a debug window similar to the one in Safari 5, to see what parameters are passed in the request.

However, the webkit nightlies also feature the new debug window so I guess it's only a matter of time before Chrome also gets this new window.

I hope this gets fixed rather sooner than later. Anyone know a solution or other workaround for this problem? Contact me on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/brtdv "@brtdv")!
