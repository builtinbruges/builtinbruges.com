Using guides in photoshop always has been a [PITA](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=PITA "Pain in the Ass") for me. But I've been using a handy plugin for the past few months and I thought I'd share.

### Guideguide

[Guideguide.me](http://guideguide.me) is a plugin which shows you a panel that lets you define  the number of columns, column width, gutter width and even margins. You can even create "sets" which let you save your most used settings.

And the best part? It's completely free. So go [check it out](http://www.guideguide.me)!
