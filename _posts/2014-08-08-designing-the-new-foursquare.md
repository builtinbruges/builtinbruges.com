[Interesting look][medium] behind the scenes of the new Foursquare design.

> We spent much of the early days talking, sketching, wire framing, and prototyping ideas and directions for the new version of Foursquare. We had regular meetings with all of the stakeholders involved, where we presented our progress, refined our ideas and honed in on what everyone was feeling strongly about. We threw away 90% of the work we did. No idea stayed sacred for too long.

To me, that's a part of the design process of which a lot of people don't seem to realize it's there. When I present a design to you, a client, there's a big amount of "stuff" you'll never see because it just *wasn't* good enough.
