Great post by [Alex Maccaw][alex_maccaw] with some great tips for setting up my favorite editor, Sublime Text 2.

> After a few weeks of using Sublime Text I can safely say that it's the best editor I've used. It's fast, extendable and hasn't ever crashed on me. That said, that no editor is perfect and Sublime Text does require a fair bit of initial configuration

I use Sublime Text 2 almost constantly, it's one of the apps that's *always* running on my mac when I'm working. I didn't know about the [AllAutocomplete][allautocomplete] plugin though, so I'll be giving that one a try this week.
