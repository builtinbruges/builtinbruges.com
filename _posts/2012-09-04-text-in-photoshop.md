### A small annoyance

When I was changing text in Photoshop and quickly wanted to switch back to whatever tool I was using before, I was never really able to do this quickly. Using keyboard shortcuts did not work, because I would be typing them, and pressing ENTER also did not work because that would just give me a new line.

So what I needed to do was to use my mouse, click the other tool I wanted to use in the Tools palette and continue my work. This was a *small* annoyance for me, especially when I was nudging stuff around and I did not want to move my hand over to my mouse and then back to the keyboard.

### The solution

So here's a little tip I discovered a while ago: if you want to quit the *'type-mode'* and be able to quickly select another tool *without* using your mouse but by using a keyboard shortcut after you're done changing text, you can press `FN + ENTER` (or the `ENTER` key on the numpad if you have a numpad on your keyboard).

By pressing `FN + ENTER`, you exit the *'type-mode'*, without using your mouse, making it possible to use the keyboard shortcuts to quickly select another tool from the tools palette!
