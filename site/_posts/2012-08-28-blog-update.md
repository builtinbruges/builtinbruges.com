A little service post today. I added the awesome [Trinch Webstudio CMS](http://www.trinch.com) as backend for this website, and updated the front a bit with a [latest posts overview](/en/blog) and an [archive](/en/archive).

From now on, the [homepage](/) only displays the latest blogpost. You can click the title of a post to see its details and continue to the [other blogposts](/en/blog).

This paves the way for some futures updates I'm planning, such as: a responsive layout, comments, short URL's,  twitter integration, categories and tags. These things will become useful when the number of posts grow.

Until those things are integrated I suggest you contact me on [twitter](//twitter.com/brtdv "@brtdv") to give me feedback.
