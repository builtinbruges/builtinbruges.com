[Cool find](https://twitter.com/adambetts/statuses/238719670620925952) of [Adam Betts](//twitter.com/adambetts "@adambetts") on twitter:

> In 10.8 if you click n hold Notification Center icon in the menubar, it’ll open, closes when click’s released. Stays when cursor moved down

[I suggested another tip](https://twitter.com/brtdv/status/238721580560175104): ⌥ click on the notification center icon disables the notifications.

I love these little things Apple adds as 'hidden feature' into software. This kind of attention to detail is *so awesome!*
