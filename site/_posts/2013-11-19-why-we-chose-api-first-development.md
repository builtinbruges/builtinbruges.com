I stumbled on this [blog post](http://blog.pop.co/post/67465239611/why-we-chose-api-first-development) by the people over at [pop.co](http://www.pop.co). Interesting. I think writing an API first and effectively using your own API makes sure that your clients also get to use a true API that is well-written and easy to use.

> By going API first, we set ourselves up to drink our own Kool-Aid so to speak. We are a client of our own API and truly utilize every endpoint. As we add more functionality, we are already in a position to offer it to consumers when the time is right

I've had the *privilege* to work on some integrations with crappy API's myself and I can definately confirm that getting to use a nice API makes for half of the work. Working API-first ensures you can achieve this at your own company.
