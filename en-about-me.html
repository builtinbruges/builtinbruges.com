		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Bert Devriese, a 29-year-old <strong>full stack developer</strong> who loves to sweat on the <strong>front-end details</strong> that make user interfaces for <strong>websites and applications</strong> great.</p>
		<p>I have been building websites since I was 12 years old and I currently have over 8 years of <strong>professional web-related experience</strong>. This includes <strong>front-end work</strong> in Photoshop, Sketch, HTML5 + CSS3 and Javascript, but also <strong>back-end coding</strong> in PHP, Ruby on Rails and site generators like Jekyll and Grunt.</p>
		<p>I believe in design that works for you and your users. This is why I like a <strong>personal, durable approach</strong> for every project and the reason I try to get to know and understand <strong>you and your audience</strong>.</p>
		<p>Because I'm experienced with different web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, HAML, Sass, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Jekyll, Bower, Grunt and Yeoman, I'm able to pick the right tool for the job.</p>
		<p>To get a better idea of my skills, check out some of my <a href="/en/work/"><strong>latest work</strong></a>. <br />
