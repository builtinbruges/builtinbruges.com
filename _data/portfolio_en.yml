    This band from **Bruges** needed a simple **promotional website** for their "Plastic Fingers" EP Release. The website design follows the EP design and has an **online form** linked to a **CRM** where people were able to **order** tickets for the release party. Another part of the project was to create print tickets with a tear-off strip.
