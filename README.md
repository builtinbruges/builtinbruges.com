# Description

This repo contains the layout and posts of the website on [builtinbruges.com](http://www.builtinbruges.com)

# Requirements

The blog is built in `jekyll`. To compile the static HTML files, `jekyll-sass` and `rdiscount` should be installed.

# Running/building this blog locally

Make sure all requirements are installed and run `jekyll`. All content from the `site` folder will be generated in a folder called `web`.

### Disclaimer

This probably isn't the most elegant solution (aka I can't push my static files through git) but my current webhoster doesn't support git so I don't need this functionality right now.
